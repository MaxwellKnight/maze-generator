# Maze Generator and Solver using DFS and BFS algorithms in JavaScript with React UI

This is a maze generator and solver web application built using JavaScript with React for the user interface. The application uses Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm to generate a random maze and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from start to end of the maze.

## Dependencies

- Node.js v14.17.6 or higher
- Vite v2.6.4 or higher
- React v17.0.2 or higher
npm
